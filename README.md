## Project Description
### Problem
In Virginia, there are the 566 licensed Long-term Care Facilities (LCFs) with approximately 19, 000 beds. The LCFs must operate
according to the Commonwealth of Virginia Chapter 73, Title 22 Standards for Licensed Assisted Living Facilities. The VA Dept of Social Services (DSS) conducts audits of the LCFs and publishes violations in narrative form on the VA DSS public website (www.dss.virginia.gov/facility/search/alf.cgi).
In the period 2017-2019, Virginia generated over 20,000 violation-related audit reports (11% related to medication administration and adherence). A study of 100 randomly selected narrative Audit Reports by Motti & Sherry (2021) identified 8 categories of Medicine Admin Violations.

### Scope Overview
Care standards and performance measures are important to inform state and national efforts to improve the quality of long-term services and support delivered across care settings and service delivery models. The Virginia Department of Social Services (VA DSS) collects narrative audit reports which were analyzed for this study to determine root causes and provide statistics for potential corrective action plans with the goal to promote proper care and equality amongst residents. The scope expands on previous research, where root causes were categorized and relationships were determined through concept maps, all while still focusing on medicine-related administration violations.

### Summary of Efforts
This study used Linear Regression for trend analysis, classification models Na√Øve Bayes, KNN and Logistic Regression to predict complaints, and Power BI for an interactive dashboard to view heat maps and violation statistics. The analytical methods provided findings in which violations are trending down in the future, classification models can be used to predict a valid complaint, and a Power BI dashboard that can be filtered in various ways to isolate specific locations and inspection details. These findings will pave the way for future studies around demographics, Long-term Care Facilities training methods, and state-to-state comparisons.
